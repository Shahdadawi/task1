    Hi, I'm Shahd, a third-year computer science student at Birzeit University. My journey in computer science has been fueled by a deep love for coding and an eagerness to learn new concepts, especially in the areas of computer systems and data structures. With each project and challenge, I enjoy delving deeper into the intricacies of technology, and I'm always on the lookout for ways to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

        Ramallah, my city, holds a special place in my heart. It’s a vibrant city in the heart of Palestine, where modernity meets tradition. The lively streets are always bustling with energy, from the cafés and shops to the cultural events that bring the community together. There’s a unique charm in its hills and the cool evening breeze that sweeps through the streets. I’ve grown up here, surrounded by the warmth of family and the rich history that tells the story of our resilience. For me, Ramallah is more than just a city—it’s home.
